title: "My Research"

In general, I'm deeply interested in measuring political attitudes and opinions primarily using dimensional scaling and machine learning. Furthermore, I have an ongoing research project with [Jack Rametta](https://jackrametta.com/) on incorporating machine learning into experimental analyses in the social sciences. So far, my previous research has worked to better understand COVID attitudes and behaviors and the dimensionality of affective polarization.
