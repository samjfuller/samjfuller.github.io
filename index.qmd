Hi there! I'm a PhD Candidate in political science at the [University of California, Davis](http://ps.ucdavis.edu/).

My substantive research focuses on better understanding public opinion, political behavior, and political psychology. Particularly, I study ideological and affective polarization as well as partisanship as an identity and am looking at its affects on policy preferences and anti-democratic attitudes. Previously, I've also worked significantly on COVID-19 attitudes, behaviors, and policy outcomes.

My methodological research is primarily focused on bridging the gap between methodologists and substantive scholars. In particular, I'm currently focused on incorporating machine learning tools into researchers' toolsets for analyzing experiments.

I'm originally from a random assortment of places in the Southeast (TN, FL, & GA) and have been living in Northern California since 2017.
