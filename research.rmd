## Research Interests

In general, I'm deeply interested in measuring political attitudes and opinions primarily using dimensional scaling and machine learning. So far, my research has worked to better understand COVID attitudes and behaviors and the dimensionality of affective polarization. In the future, I aim to continue studying affective and ideological polarization in the United States (and elsewhere), and their interrelationship.
