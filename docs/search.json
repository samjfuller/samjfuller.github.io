    "text": "In general, I’m deeply interested in measuring political attitudes and opinions primarily using dimensional scaling and machine learning. Furthermore, I have an ongoing research project with Jack Rametta on incorporating machine learning into experimental analyses in the social sciences. So far, my previous research has worked to better understand COVID attitudes and behaviors and the dimensionality of affective polarization.\nPublications\n\nPopulism and the affective partisan space in nine European publics: Evidence from a cross-national survey\n\nWith Will Horne, James Adams, & Noam Gidron\n\nAssessing the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine lotteries: A cross-state synthetic control methods approach\n\nWith Sara Kazemian, Carlos Algara, & Daniel J.

    "text": "Hi there! I’m a PhD Candidate in political science at the University of California, Davis.\nMy substantive research focuses on better understanding public opinion, political behavior, and political psychology. Particularly, I study ideological and affective polarization as well as partisanship as an identity and am looking at its affects on policy preferences and anti-democratic attitudes. Previously, I’ve also worked significantly on COVID-19 attitudes, behaviors, and policy outcomes.\nMy methodological research is primarily focused on bridging the gap between methodologists and substantive scholars. In particular, I’m currently focused on incorporating machine learning tools into researchers’ toolsets for analyzing experiments."
