    "text": "Hi there! I‚Äôm a PhD Candidate in political science at the University of California, Davis.\nMy methodological research is primarily focused on creating new, and applying existing, machine learning methods for the analysis of experimental and survey data. Importantly, I care deeply about bridging the gap between methodologists who create theses methods and substantive scholars who would benefit greatly from using these methods. In that vein, I‚Äôm currently working on a series of projects with Jack T. Rametta that introduces standardized, easy-to-use ML methods for analyzing experimental data. Our first methodological and substantive papers in this series are currently under review and available here and here on OSF, respectively. I‚Äôm more than happy to field any questions and I‚Äôm definitely interested in receiving useful feedback!\nMy substantive research focuses on, first, improving our measurement and, second, increasing our understanding of phenomenon in public opinion, political behavior, and political psychology. Particularly, I study ideological and affective polarization as well as partisanship as an identity and am looking at its affects on policy preferences and anti-democratic attitudes. Additionally, I am also interested in a wide-array of social science questions, including those in Sociology. I am currently working on a project with Professor Caitlin Patler that leverages machine learning (specifically, DoubleML) to estimate the causal effects of immigration detention/incarceration on mental and physical health.\nI have published in journals such as PLOS One, Social Science Quarterly, Politics & Gender, and Frontiers in Political Science. My previous work focuses primarily on COVID-19 attitudes, behaviors, and policy outcomes. I also have a paper on leveraging multidimensional scaling to measure ideology and populism in Western Europe (I think it‚Äôs a neat paper, check it out!).\nAs for me, I‚Äôm originally from a random assortment of places in the Southeast (TN, FL, & GA) and have been living in Northern California since I started my PhD in 2017. In my free time I pet dogs, talk to much about movies, and try to raise awareness about social justice issues in and outside of the US.\n\nResearch interests\nMachine Learning | Experiments | Political Psychology | Affective Polarization\n\n\nEducation\nüéì PhD in Political Science, 2024 (Ongoing) | University of California, Davis\nüéì BS in Political Science & Economics, 2016 | Berry College"
