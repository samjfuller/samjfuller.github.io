    "text": "In general, I‚Äôm deeply interested in measuring political attitudes and opinions primarily using dimensional scaling and machine learning. Furthermore, I have an ongoing research project with Jack Rametta on incorporating machine learning into experimental analyses in the social sciences. So far, my previous research has worked to better understand COVID attitudes and behaviors and the dimensionality of affective polarization.\nForthcoming\n\nAdvanced Machine Learning for Experiments in the Social Sciences\n\nWith Jack T. Rametta & Christopher D. Hare\nUnder advance contract for publication in the Cambridge Elements Experimental Political Science Series\n\n\n‚ÄúMachine learning tools are being more frequently adopted to various stages of the social science workflow. However, this field‚Äôs growth has been limited by a lack of principled instruction on applying these methods and the esoteric nature of their current implementations. This Element introduces a comprehensive approach for social scientists looking to incorporate machine learning methods into experimental analysis. Specifically, we provide a flexible, data-driven approach to improve performance on tasks such as balance testing, attrition detection, the measurement of abstract concepts, and treatment effect estimation. Throughout, we detail the advantages of machine learning over traditional methods for these applications and provide practical guidance for evaluating validity, enhancing performance, and presenting results. We conclude by summarizing the myriad implications of these methods for experimental design, including how they integrate with pre-registration. Additionally, we provide a family of R packages with accompanying code and interactive walkthroughs to guide researchers through the host of methods and processes covered. This Element provides an approachable guide for social scientists who wish to apply cutting-edge machine learning methods to enhance the quality and resolution of their experimental research.‚Äù\nPublications\n\nPopulism and the affective partisan space in nine European publics: Evidence from a cross-national survey\n\nWith Will Horne, James Adams, & Noam Gidron\n\nAssessing the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine lotteries: A cross-state synthetic control methods approach\n\nWith Sara Kazemian, Carlos Algara, & Daniel J.

    "text": "News & Updates\nMy frequent collaborator, Jack T. Rametta, and I will be teaching an ICPSR Summer Program Topical Workshop titled ‚ÄúCausal Machine Learning for Observational and Experimental Research‚Äù. If you‚Äôre interested in our CML work, definitely check this class out!\nRelatedly, our working paper ‚ÄúCausal Forest and Doubly Robust Machine Learning for Political Science‚Äù is now available on OSF.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n    \n  \n    \n     Scholar\n  \n  \n    \n     Github\n  \n\n  \n  \n\nAbout Me\nHi there! I‚Äôm a Postdoctoral Fellow in Public Opinion and Survey Methodology at the Center for American Political Studies in the Department of Government at Harvard University.\nMy methodological research is primarily focused on creating new, and applying existing, machine learning methods for the analysis of experimental and survey data. Importantly, I care deeply about bridging the gap between methodologists who create theses methods and substantive scholars who would benefit greatly from using these methods. In that vein, I‚Äôm currently working on a series of projects with Jack T. Rametta that introduces standardized, easy-to-use ML methods for analyzing experimental data. Our first methodological and substantive papers in this series are currently under review and available here and here on OSF, respectively. I‚Äôm more than happy to field any questions and I‚Äôm definitely interested in receiving useful feedback!\nMy substantive research focuses on, first, improving our measurement and, second, increasing our understanding of phenomenon in public opinion, political behavior, and political psychology. Particularly, I study ideological and affective polarization as well as partisanship as an identity and am looking at its affects on policy preferences and anti-democratic attitudes. Additionally, I am also interested in a wide-array of social science questions, including those in Sociology. I am currently working on a project with Professor Caitlin Patler that leverages machine learning (specifically, DoubleML) to estimate the causal effects of immigration detention/incarceration on mental and physical health.\nI have published in journals such as PLOS One, Social Science Quarterly, Politics & Gender, and Frontiers in Political Science. My previous work focuses primarily on COVID-19 attitudes, behaviors, and policy outcomes. I also have a paper on leveraging multidimensional scaling to measure ideology and populism in Western Europe (I think it‚Äôs a neat paper, check it out!).\n\n\n\nResearch interests\nMachine Learning | Experiments | Political Behavior | Affective Polarization\n\n\nEducation\nüéì PhD in Political Science | University of California, Davis\nüéì BS in Political Science & Economics | Berry College"
