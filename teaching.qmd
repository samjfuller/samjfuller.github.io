This page is organized in two sections. The first is a record of courses that I've assisted with, both graduate and undergraduate. Primarily, I've worked on assisting [Chris Hare](https://www.christopherdhare.com/) with his machine learning course at the ICPSR Summer Program. The second is a summary of additional lectures and seminars I've conducted in and out of courses and within my department. I've included access to these documents where available.
